House Price Prediction Using Machine Learning - Regression Model


‚Ä¢ Developed a House Price Prediction Model using a Kaggle dataset with 2,919 rows and 13 features, 
incorporating an interactive Streamlit UI for real-time predictions.


‚Ä¢ Designed a clean, user-friendly interface enabling users to input parameters like Square Feet, 
Bedrooms, Bathrooms, Neighborhood Type, and Year Built for instant price estimates.



‚Ä¢ Conducted detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify key predictors influencing house 
prices, applying effective feature engineering for improved accuracy.



‚Ä¢ Trained and compared multiple regression models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and 
Support Vector Machine (SVM), achieving an accuracy of approximately 18% Mean Absolute Error.


 
‚Ä¢ Deployed the application on Hugging Face using Streamlit, providing an accessible platform for real
time predictions and empowering users with actionable property insights.



üè† House Price Prediction using ML (Regression Project)
Built a House Price Prediction system using real-world Kaggle data, applying Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models to predict property prices based on features like square feet, bedrooms, bathrooms, and year built.

Processed and cleaned raw data with 1,400+ property records, addressing missing values, encoding neighborhood types (Urban, Semi-Urban, Rural), and scaling continuous features to enhance model accuracy.

Performed detailed univariate & bivariate EDA using 20+ visualizations (scatter plots, distribution graphs, boxplots) to study price influence across variables like year of construction and area.

Compared 4 regression algorithms, identifying SVM as the most accurate, achieving a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of ~18%, outperforming other models in predictive consistency.

Deployed the final model using Streamlit & Hugging Face Spaces, building a live web app for users to input house parameters and get real-time price predictions in a user-friendly interface.
