House Price Prediction Using Machine Learning - Regression Model


• Developed a House Price Prediction Model using a Kaggle dataset with 2,919 rows and 13 features, 
incorporating an interactive Streamlit UI for real-time predictions.


• Designed a clean, user-friendly interface enabling users to input parameters like Square Feet, 
Bedrooms, Bathrooms, Neighborhood Type, and Year Built for instant price estimates.



• Conducted detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify key predictors influencing house 
prices, applying effective feature engineering for improved accuracy.



• Trained and compared multiple regression models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and 
Support Vector Machine (SVM), achieving an accuracy of approximately 18% Mean Absolute Error.


 
• Deployed the application on Hugging Face using Streamlit, providing an accessible platform for real
time predictions and empowering users with actionable property insights.
